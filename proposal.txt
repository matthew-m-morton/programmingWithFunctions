Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    valheim_boss_hits.py

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    This program will promt the user for their weapon of choice and use it
    to calculate how many hits (or shots) from the weapon it will take to 
    defeat a choosen boss.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    how to make dictionaries from csv(s), multiple if, elif, else statements 
    and lots of calculations made based on user input. 

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    The csv and math modules.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    yes there will need to be multiple functions. Off the top of my head 
    there will need to be a dicionary function, at least one calculation function
    and maybe a list function.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    Yes I will, it will be easy and nessissary to test the calculation function(s)  

(Remember that it's hard to test functions that get user input and print
output. It's easy to test functions that don't get user input and don't
print output but instead have parameters and return a result. Therefore,
you should write most of your program functions to have parameters and
return a result.)
